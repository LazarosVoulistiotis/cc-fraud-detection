# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
A **real-world inspired system** for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Python** and **Machine Learning**.  

This project simulates a **production-ready ML pipeline**:  
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Training and comparing multiple ML models  
- Evaluating trade-offs between false positives and false negatives  
- Future deployment as a REST API & web app  

The goal is to deliver something **practical for companies** and **reproducible for research**.

## 📊 Dataset  
- Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **284,807 transactions**, of which **492 are fraudulent (0.17%)**  
- Highly **imbalanced dataset** → handled via resampling & anomaly detection techniques  

⚠️ Dataset stored in `data/data_raw/` (ignored by Git).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries  
- **Python 3.13.0**  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** → experimentation  
- **NumPy** → numerical computing  
- **Pandas** → data handling  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** → visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → ML models & evaluation  
- **ipykernel** → Jupyter integration

## 🔬 Methods  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize numerical features  
   - Manage class imbalance (SMOTE / undersampling)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Fraud vs. non-fraud distribution  
   - Correlations, PCA visualization  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gradient Boosting  
   - Neural Networks (optional, advanced)  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - ROC-AUC & PR-AUC  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Cross-validation  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Comparative results of models (tables + plots)  
- ROC & PR curves for visualization  
- Discussion of trade-offs (false positives vs. false negatives)  

📌 *This section will be continuously updated as experiments progress.*
